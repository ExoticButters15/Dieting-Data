# CISC 191 Final Project

## Project Proposal

**Overview**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized chronologically based on user's input of time. A water counter will be included as well.

- [x] Edit -> Select an item and change the name, type, or details
- [x] View -> See all details of items based on users choice

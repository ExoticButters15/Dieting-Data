# CISC 191 Final Project

## Project Proposal

**Overview**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized chronologically based on user's input of time. A water counter will be included as well.

**Development Tasks:**

- [ ] Get user input -> "food or water"
- [ ] Store input accordingly
- [ ] Attach additional details to input such as time and details ( snack, meal (meat, carb, vegetable, etc.))
- [ ] Sort and organize inputed items
- [ ] Option to edit previous input and add more
- [ ] Export data to save for later edits

## Project Checkpoints:

**Week 1:**
UML Diagram with CRC cards completed. Class interactions and implementations are clear. Project is concise enough to begin coding, slight adjustments to capabilities or additional features can easily be edited before final submission. Early draft can begin coding.

**Week 2:**
Asking for inital date, setting up intial startup frame including layout and components. Will finish a few test cases before moving to Week 3. Finishing the buttons, labels, and progressbar. No listeners have been connected. Also mapped out the chronologial order of pop-ups, squencing, and actions (on paper)

**Week 3**
Program is working appropriately. All components have effective event handling, and the program works as intended. However, the GUI is underdevloped with little to no formatting, and the file I/O module has not been implemented. Will do test cases and exception handling first and leave Week 7 for final GUI.

**Week 4**
Test cases are still being implemented. Focusing on making test cases that interact with every component and aspect of the program. All the way to the point where I do not need to run and input data into the program, instead just run the test case file.

**Week 5**
Test cases are completed. All modules from 1-9 are effectively used in the project, except module 8 (Exception Handling). The program could easily be broken by faulty user input. I am making more test cases and custom exceptions to throw, catch, and stop the program from not only breaking, but making the user experience more fluid and purposeful.

**Week 6**
Most exceptions are handled. Still looking for weak spots and bugs in the program. I also started fixing the GUI for the final product.

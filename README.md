# Diet-Tracker
## CISC191 Final Project: DietingData

**Project Proposal/Overview:**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized chronologically based on user's input of time. A water counter will be included as well.

**Development Tasks:**

- [ ] Get user input -> "food or water"
- [ ] Store input accordingly
- [ ] Attach additional details to input such as time and details ( snack, meal (meat, carb, vegetable, etc.))
- [ ] Sort and organize inputed items
- [ ] Option to edit previous input and add more
- [ ] Export data to save for later edits

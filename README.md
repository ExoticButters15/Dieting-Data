# Diet-Tracker
## CISC191 Final Project: DietingData

**Project Proposal/Overview:**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized based on the user's input of time, characteristics, etc. A water counter will be included as well.

**Development Tasks:**

[ ] Get user input -> "food or water"
[ ] Store input accordingly
[ ] Attach additional details to input such as time, snack, meal (meat, carb, vegetable, etc.)
[ ] Organize input based on user preference -> "certain details or chronological"
[ ] Option to edit previous input or add more
[ ] Export data to save for later edits

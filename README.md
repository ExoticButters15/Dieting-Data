# Diet-Tracker
## CISC191 Final Project: DietingData

**Project Proposal**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized based on the user's input of time, characteristics, etc. A water counter will be included as well.

# CISC 191 Final Project

## Project Proposal

**Overview**

Tracking what you put in your body is important, but no one has the time to note or jot down every meal, snack, and drink they have in a day. DietingData will be an application where the user can add what they eat in a day. Each food will be organized chronologically based on user's input of time. A water counter will be included as well.

**Development Tasks:**

- [ ] Get user input -> "food or water"
- [ ] Store input accordingly
- [ ] Attach additional details to input such as time and details ( snack, meal (meat, carb, vegetable, etc.))
- [ ] Sort and organize inputed items
- [ ] Option to edit previous input and add more
- [ ] Export data to save for later edits

## Project Checkpoints:

**Week 1:**
UML Diagram with CRC cards completed. Class interactions and implementations are clear. Project is concise enough to begin coding, slight adjustments to capabilities or additional features can easily be edited before final submission. Early draft can begin coding.

**Week 2:**
Asking for inital date, setting up intial startup frame including layout and components. Will finish a few test cases before moving to Week 3. Finishing the buttons, labels, and progressbar. No listeners have been connected. Also mapped out the chronologial order of pop-up and actions.

**Week 3**
